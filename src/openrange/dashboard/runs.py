"""Runs directory discovery + per-run ``DashboardView`` registry.

Tensorboard-style: the dashboard server points at a parent directory
(``--runs-dir``), discovers every subdirectory that has the dashboard
artifacts written by ``OpenRangeRun`` (``dashboard.events.jsonl`` +
``dashboard.json``), and surfaces them as runs the SPA can list and
switch between.

Discovery is filesystem-driven and refreshed lazily — each call to
``RunsRegistry.list_runs()`` re-scans, so newly minted run directories
appear without a server restart. Per-run ``DashboardView`` instances
are cached on first request and reused thereafter; each one is
constructed with ``tail=True`` so its bridge keeps pace with events
the writer process appends after the view was created.
