"""``cyber.office_chatter`` — a person walking around the office.

Scripted, no LLM. The chatter owns every "what NPCs do" decision
itself and ships them on its events: which desk slot it lives at
(``home_index``), which colleague it's visiting on a given walk
(``target_name``), and the opener-and-reply pair the two will
exchange. The dashboard reads those fields straight from the event
data and renders — it doesn't invent identity-to-position mappings
or pick who visits whom.

Config:
    name: str (required)             — display name + actor_id
    colleagues: list[str] = ()       — names of other chatters this
                                       NPC can visit; required for
                                       walks to land on a real host
    cadence_ticks: int = 6           — act every Nth tick
    home: str | None = None          — optional service-id ``target``
                                       on the move event
    walk_probability: float = 1.0    — chance an acting tick walks
    seed: int | None = None          — deterministic randomness
